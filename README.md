# CLStudentRoster

  I built a Student Roster console application, it is a basic CRUD app I devloped as a easy to use and fun way to keep track of student data. This app can be used to Add, Delete, List and Edit student data such as completed classes and dates completed, up coming courses and other student information. I build it with a easy to navigate user menu with minimal requirements to run.  To run the program you need to have Newtonsoft Json frame installed because the namespace is used to parse the class data.  That's the basic break down of this application. Enjoy!
